# Crowdfunding-ETL

## Purpose
The purpose of this module is to learn how to extract, transform, and clean data. Then we are able to use this data to create an ERD and load the data to perform SQL Analysis. We are able to clean up large data sets in order to efficiently retrieve data revolving around Independent Funding's crowdfunding platform.
